"""Tier verification + probabilistic audit sampling (architecture.md 3.4/3.5).

The proof tier a worker CLAIMS is an input to the audit rate, so it must never be trusted verbatim:
a claim is only worth its tier if the backing metadata is verifiable. :func:`effective_tier` maps a
proof's CLAIMED tier onto the EFFECTIVE tier the audit scheduler actually consumes:

* claimed tier >= 2 -> effective 0 always (Prism no longer elevates via TEE; claim/attestation
  fields may remain on the wire for compatibility but never authorize tier 2);
* claimed tier 1 -> effective 1 iff ``constation_ok`` is True (M14 sole elevation predicate),
  else effective 0. Self-reported image digests and pin match alone never elevate;
* claimed tier 0 (or any unknown tier) -> effective 0.

Max effective tier is **1**. :class:`AuditSampler` then samples finalized results at the per-tier
rate of their EFFECTIVE tier. Sampling is deterministic in the sampler's ``seed`` and the
per-result key, so the same seed reproduces the same sample set (VAL-PRISM-011) and a downgraded
claim is audited at its lower (effective) rate rather than the rate it dishonestly claimed
(VAL-PRISM-019).
