"""Live master orchestration driver (architecture.md sec 4, "Master orchestration").

The master is autonomous in production: a background driver periodically

1. bridges each challenge's gated *pending work units* into ``work_assignments``
   (agent-challenge: one cpu unit per selected task; prism: exactly one gpu unit
   per submission), then
2. runs the full reassignment pass (``detect_offline`` -> reclaim
   stale/deadline-expired in-flight units -> ``assign_pending``), so newly
   eligible work and newly-online validators get balanced assignments and
   crashed/expired work is reclaimed and reassigned without any manual trigger,
   then
3. folds permanently-failed (retry-exhausted, ``attempt_count == max_attempts``)
   agent-challenge work units on the challenge side so their evaluation jobs
   finalize instead of hanging forever waiting for a result that will never
   come. The fold is a durable sweep over still-failed-but-unfolded units, so a
   fold that fails during a challenge outage is retried on a later pass.

The source of challenge pending work and the challenge-side fold are abstracted
behind :class:`ChallengeWorkSource` / :class:`ChallengeFoldTrigger` so they can
be mocked in tests; the production HTTP implementations live in
:mod:`base.master.challenge_work_source`.

    installing ``base`` (master) auto-deploy every ACTIVE challenge and makes a
    newly-registered ACTIVE challenge propagate automatically on the next pass,

    created for a challenge that is no longer ACTIVE is stopped even though this
    process never had that slug in ``_deployed`` (the live-observed orphan gap
    after a proxy restart).

    Idempotency: a challenge already deployed/adopted by this process is left
    untouched on subsequent passes (start is called exactly once per challenge),
    a still-ACTIVE challenge whose service is already running is ADOPTED (its
    slug tracked without calling start again, so a healthy service is never
    recreated), and the underlying :meth:`start_challenge` itself reuses an
    existing service. A start/stop that raises is logged and retried on the next
